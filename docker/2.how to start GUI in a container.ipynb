    "Docker's normally used to containerise background applications and CLI programs. You can also use it to run graphical programs though! You can either use an existing X Server, where the host machine is already running a graphical environment, or you can run a VNC server within the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "First it's important to understand what Docker actually does. A Docker \"container\" is a form of *encapsulation* which seems to be superficially similar to a virtual machine. Unlike a virtual machine, containers share the same Linux kernel as their host system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next component is the X Window System. <font color=green>**X Servers such as Xorg provide the fundamental graphical capabilities of Unix systems. GUI applications can't render without an X Server available**</font>. (Alternative windowing systems, such as Wayland, are available - we're focusing on X in this article.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to run an X Server in Docker is theoretically possible but rarely used. You'd need to run Docker in privileged mode\n",
    "```shell\n",
    " --privileged\n",
    "```\n",
    "so it could access your host's hardware. Starting the server would try to claim your video devices, usually resulting in loss of video output as your host's original X server gets its devices yanked away.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='green'>**A better approach is to mount your host's X Server socket into the Docker container**</font>. This allows your container to use the X Server you already have. GUI applications running in the container would then appear on your existing desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forwarding An X Socket to A Docker Container\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing a Docker container with access to your host's X socket is a straightforward procedure. The X socket can be found in\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "/tmp/.X11-unix\n",
    "```\n",
    "on your host. The contents of this directory should be mounted into a Docker volume assigned to the container. You'll need to use the `host` networking mode for this to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must also provide the container with a `DISPLAY` environment variable. This instructs X clients - your graphical programs - which X server to connect to. Set `DISPLAY` in the container to the value of `$DISPLAY` on your host.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can encapsulate all this configuration in one `docker-compose.yml` file:\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "version: \"3\"\n",
    "services:\n",
    "app:\n",
    "    image: my-app:latest\n",
    "    build: .\n",
    "    environment:\n",
    "    - DISPLAY=${DISPLAY}\n",
    "    volumes:\n",
    "    - /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix\n",
    "    network_mode: host\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach should only be used when you trust your Docker container. Exposing the host's display server is a security risk if you're not completely sure what lies inside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling X Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "You might need to authenticate the container to access the X Server. First get an X authentication token from your host machine. Run `xauth list` and note down one of the listed cookies. You'll need to copy the entire line.\n",
    "\n",
    "![xauth_list](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/csit/2021/04/4a47a0db.png?q=50&fit=crop&w=943&dpr=1.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the Docker container, install the xauth package. Then run `xauth add`, passing the token you copied in the previous step.\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "apt install -y xauth\n",
    "xauth add <token>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Your container should now successfully authenticate to the X Server."
