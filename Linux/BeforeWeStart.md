# Shell Script VS Python Script?

To give input you should know the difference between Python scripting and Shell scripting.

## What is Shell Scripting?

**Shell** is just a programming interpreter that is useful to access operating system services. **And Shell scripting is nothing but writing multiple commands on the shell to complete a certain task, those tasks are high related with Operation System**. When we talk about shell scripting, Bash is considered to be the most prominent Unix shell and programming language. Apart from Bash, there are many scripting languages such as sh, csh, dash… But, bash is more matured and widely used among all. Bash is used to writing command line coding. So, in other words, we can say, bash is command language. **Whereas Python is not a just scripting language, it is a complete programming language**.

### Is Python Programming a Scripting Language?

Why do I call Python as a complete programming language rather just scripting language? Now consider you have to write code that needs a data structure to store the input or output values. You can use a variable in a bash script to store a single value. But there is no such advance data structure privileged such as list, dictionary or set. These advance data structures are available in Python. Python can be used for web development as it has various web development framework such as bottle framework. The wide range of libraries can be useful for data science and data analytics, machine learning and what not… Looking at this scalability and use cases, it’s wise to call Python as a complete programming language.***So, the answer to this question is that Python is a Script language but not just a Script language but a complete programming language***

## Python vs Shell Scripting:

***Now let’s start differentiating Python Vs Shell Scripting***. Suppose you are writing a script to replaces some string in a file with other string. It is just a couple of lines of code in a bash script. That, you can also write in Python. And if you are importing any library, it will be even easy to make the things work for you. Other **advantages of Python over bash** is, there are lots of external libraries you can import and use it without any hustle. It reduces your program length and coding effort. In Python, most of the things you can do by calling one line function from the imported library. Isn’t that so easy? But there are some places you need shell scripting.

### When do we use Shell scripting?

Shell or bash scripting is only preferable if you are interested in **system administration work**. And it is extremely powerful in this field. Now on another side, if you know both Python and bash script. It will be honey over the bread. If you are a newbie, I would suggest learning basic bash command that can speed up your productivity working in Linux environment. You don’t need to be the God of shell programming unless you are working as data administrator. Basic commands are enough to improve your productivity. So command line coding language like bash scripting and complete programming language like Python have their own features to differentiate between them. Moreover, I would suggest you go and learn both of these computer languages. **Having a good command to shell, you can find it very handy and useful if you are primarily working on a Unix or Linux environment**.

### Where does shell scripting lack over Python?

In other words, what are the advantages of Python over Shell scripting? Up to now, it’s very fine with shell scripting. Suppose you want to use an array, data structure or you need some data manipulations in your project task. Things will start feeling the heat with bash scripting. And this is where you need to hone some Python skills. After getting comfortable with shell commands, learn the Python programming language. You will find an improvement in your productivity as you have basic shell commands for quick moves. I can tell you, whatever you have done with bash scripting you can do the same with Python programming.

**Note:** I have differentiated both of these languages depending on their programming capabilities. Nowhere I have considered trends and job requirements. If you are looking for a future job, Python is the future programming language.

## In a word

A shell script is more or less a list of commands to run at the bash prompt. It does have a language to it (called Bourne shell) but it’s very minimalistic and only considered good enough for writing system administration utilities and stuff like that. Most people don’t consider it a “real” programming language. It’s more just a way of automating things that would normally require typing lots of commands manually.

Python is a real programming language with all the features of a real programming language.

Both get called “scripts” and both are stored in text files, but other than that they’re totally different languages, **shell focus on Operation System Control and python can work on both object-oriented language and Operation System Control with proper library**.
