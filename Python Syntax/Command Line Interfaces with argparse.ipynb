    "* Lines 5 to 15 define four functions that perform the basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These functions will provide the operations behind each of your app’s subcommands.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Line 17 defines the command-line argument parser as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lines 18 to 20 define a subparser by calling <font color='blue'>.add_subparsers()</font>. In this call, you provide a title and a help message.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lines 22 to 28 define a template for your command-line arguments. This template is a dictionary containing sensitive values for the required arguments of <font color='blue'>.add_argument()</font>. Each argument will be called `operands` and will consist of two floating-point values. Defining this template allows you to avoid repetitive code when creating the command-line arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Line 30 adds a parser to the subparser object. The name of this subparser is add and will represent your subcommand for addition operations. The help argument defines a help message for this parser in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Line 31 adds the operands command-line argument to the add subparser using .add_argument() with the argument template. Note that you need to use the dictionary unpacking operator (**) to extract the argument template from arg_template.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Line 32 uses .set_defaults() to assign the add() callback function to the add subparser or subcommand.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lines 34 to 44 perform actions similar to those in lines 30 to 32 for the rest of your three subcommands, sub, mul, and div. Finally, line 48 calls the func attribute from args. This attribute will automatically call the function associated with the subcommand at hand."
