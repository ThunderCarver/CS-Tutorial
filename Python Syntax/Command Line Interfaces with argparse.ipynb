The information exchange has flowed among humans, computer software, and hardware components. The shared boundary between any two of these elements is generically known as an interface.\n",

However, you’ll also find apps and programs that provide command-line interfaces (CLIs) for their users. In this tutorial, you’ll learn about CLIs and how to create them in Python."

    "* Option, also known as flag or switch: An optional argument that modifies a command’s behavior. Options are passed to commands using a specific name, like -l in the previous example.\n",

    "* sample: An argument that provides additional information to the command’s execution\n",

    "$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n",

    "* pip: The command’s name\n",
    "* install: The name of a subcommand of pip\n",
    "* -r: An option of the install subcommand\n",
