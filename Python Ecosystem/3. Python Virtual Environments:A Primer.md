# Python Virtual Environments: A Primer

[Virtual Environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)

## What is a Virtual Environment?

A virtual environment is a directory tree which contains **`Python executable files`** and **`other files`** which indicate that it is a virtual environment.

**At its core, the main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects.** This means that each project can have its own dependencies, regardless of what dependencies every other project has.

When a virtual environment is active (i.e., the virtual environment’s Python interpreter is running), the attributes [sys.prefix](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.prefix) and [sys.exec_prefix](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exec_prefix) point to the base directory of the virtual environment, whereas [sys.base_prefix](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.base_prefix)and[sys.base_exec_prefix](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.base_exec_prefix) point to the non-virtual environment Python installation which was used to create the virtual environment. If a virtual environment is not active, then [sys.prefix](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.prefix) is the same as [sys.base_prefix](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.base_prefix) and [sys.exec_prefix](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exec_prefix) is the same as [sys.base_exec_prefix](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.base_exec_prefix) (they all point to a non-virtual environment Python installation).

When a virtual environment is active, any options that change the installation path will be ignored to prevent projects being inadvertently(粗心的，无意的) installed outside of the virtual environment.

## What’s inside a Virtual Environment?

**It is a directory or a Python environment that Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into, and isolated from other python environments.** Python interpreter,libraries and scripts are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments,and (by default) any libraries installed in a “system” Python,i.e., one which is installed as part of your operating system.

## Why Need Virtual Environments?

**The most direct purpose is to manage different python projects.** Python, like most other modern programming languages, has its own unique way of downloading, storing, and resolving packages(or modules).While this has its advantages, there were some interesting decisions made about package storage and resolution, which has lead to some problems—particularly with how and where packages are stored.

There are a few different locations where these packages can be installed on your system. For example, most system packages are stored in a child directory of the path stored in [sys.prefix](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.prefix).

On Mac OS X, you can easily find where sys.prefix points to using the Python shell:

```python
import sys
sys.prefix'/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5'
```

third party packages installed using `easy_install` or `pip` are typically placed in one of the directories pointed to by site.getsitepackages:

```
import site
site.getsitepackages()
'/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/Extras/lib/python',
'/Library/Python/3.5/site-packages'
```

Some projects need different version of target package. In this scenario these different version packages cannot be installed under same directory, since the interpreter cannot differentiate which version should be used.

## Create Virtual Environment

To get started, if you’re not using Python 3, you’ll want to install the `virtualenv` tool with pip: `shell script $ pip install virtualenv` If you are using Python 3, then you should already have the `venv` module from the standard library installed. Now, create a new virtual environment:

`shell script #python 3的method': $ python3.5 -m venv /virtual/environment/path/myenvname` The Python 3.5 venv approach has the benefit of forcing you to choose a specific version of the Python 3 interpreter that should be used to create the virtual environment. This avoids any confusion as to which Python installation the new environment is based on.

In the above example, this command creates a directory called `myenvname`, which contains a directory structure similar to this:

```
├── bin
│   ├── activate
│   ├── activate.csh
│   ├── activate.fish
│   ├── easy_install
│   ├── easy_install-3.5
│   ├── pip
│   ├── pip3
│   ├── pip3.5
│   ├── python -> python3.5
│   ├── python3 -> python3.5
│   └── python3.5 -> /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin/python3.5
├── include
├── lib
│   └── python3.5
│       └── site-packages
├── pyvenv.cfg
└── share
```

Here’s what each folder contains: * bin: files that interact with the virtual environment * include: C headers that compile the Python packages * lib: a copy of the Python version along with a site-packages folder where each dependency is installed

- The rest files are used to ensure that all Python code and commands are executed within the context of the current environment, which is .
    
    **how the isolation from the global environment is achieved**
    

We’ll explain this in more detail in the next section.As for the activate scripts in the bin directory. ***These scripts are used to set up your shell to use the environment’s Python executable and its site-packages by default***.In order to use this environment’s packages/resources in isolation, you need to “activate” it in terminal.

```shell script 
$ source myenvpath/bin/activate
``` 
Notice how your prompt is now prefixed with the name of your environment(`myenv` in this case). This is the indicator that `myenv` is currently active, which means the python executable will only use this environment’s packages and settings. If you want to exit from your virtual environment,and back to normal, you need **deactivate the activate environment** in terminal 
```shell script 
$ deactivate
``` 

## Delete your virtual environment

There is no command for deleting your virtual environment. Simply deactivate it and delete your virtual environment folder.

```
$ deactivate
$ rm -r your/virtual\ environment/folder
```

Note that this is the same regardless of what kind of virtual environment you are using. `virtualenv`, `venv`, `Anaconda environment`, `pyenv`, `pipenv` are all based the same principle.

### What happens when activate a Virtual Environment?

What exactly does it mean to “activate” an environment? Knowing what’s going on under the hood can be pretty important for a developer, especially when you need to understand execution environments, dependency resolution, and so on.

To explain how this works, let’s first check out the locations of the different python executables. With the environment “deactivated,” run the following: 
```shell script 
$ where python /usr/bin/python
``` 
Now, activate a virtual environment and run the command again: 
```shell script 
$ source myenv/bin/activate 
$ (myenv) where python 
/Users/xxx/Desktop/myenv/bin/python /usr/bin/python
``` 
After activating the environment, we’re now getting a different path for the python executable because in an active environment, the `$PATH environment variable` is slightly modified.

Notice the difference between the first path in $PATH before and after the activation:

***if you want to see all the environment variables, input `printenv` in terminal***:

```
printenv

TMPDIR=/var/folders/7j/2906_67j10jb96fwf1f0ypch0000gn/T/
XPC_FLAGS=0x0
TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION=433
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal
XPC_SERVICE_NAME=0
TERM_SESSION_ID=CD629478-3E24-4790-9A08-501E70ABD069
TERM=xterm-256color
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.Y1VrrwDm4l/Listeners
SHELL=/bin/zsh
HOME=/Users/lav
LOGNAME=lav
USER=lav
PATH=/Users/xxx/anaconda3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin:/Library/Apple/usr/bin
SHLVL=1
PWD=/Users/lav
OLDPWD=/Users/lav
_=/usr/bin/printenv
```

```shell script 
$ echo $PATH 
/Users/xxx/…/anaconda3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin:/Library/Apple/usr/bin

$ source /Users/xxx/Desktop/myenv/bin/activate 
$ (myenv) echo $PATH /Users/xxx/Desktop/myenv/bin:/Users/xxx/.../anaconda3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Library/TeX/texbin:/Library/Apple/usr/bin 
``` 
In the latter example, our virtual environment’s bin directory is now at the beginning of the PATH.That means **when running an executable on the command line, it’s the first searching directory. If the executable command is not found in the first searching directory, then keep searching the next directory in `$PATH`. If the command cannot be found in all`$PATH`, then prompt`command not find`**. Thus, the shell uses our virtual environment’s instance of Python instead of the system-wide version.

```
Note: Other packages that bundle Python, like Anaconda, also tend to manipulate your path when you activate them. 
Just be aware of this in case you run into problems with your other environments. This can become a problem 
if you start activating multiple environments at once.
```

This raises the following questions: 
* What’s the difference between these two executables anyway? 
* How is the virtual environment’s Python executable able to use something other than the system’s site-packages?

Answers:

This can be explained by how Python starts up and where it is located on the system. There actually isn’t any difference between these two Python executables. **It’s their directory locations that matter.**

---

### How Does a Virtual Environment Work?

When Python is starting up, it looks at the path of its binary.

In a virtual environment, it is actually just a copy of, or symlink to, your system’s Python binary. It then sets the location of **`sys.prefix`** and **`sys.exec_prefix`** based on this location, omitting the bin portion of the path.

The path located in `sys.prefix` is then used for locating the site-packages directory by searching the relative path `lib/pythonX.X/site-packages/`, where `X.X` is the version of Python you’re using.
1. In our example, the **binary(activate operation)** is located at /Users/xxx/Desktop/myenv/bin, which means `sys.prefix` would be /Users/xxx/Desktop/myenv. 2. therefore the **site-packages directory** used would be /Users/xxx/Desktop/myenv/lib/pythonX.X/site-packages. 3. Finally, this path is stored in the `sys.path` array, which contains all of the locations where a package can reside.

```python
import sys
sys.prefix'Users/xxx/Desktop/myenv'
```

```python
import sys
sys.path['', '/Users/xxx/Desktop/myenv/lib/python3.7/site-packages']
```

# How Rename your Virtual Environment

**[Don’t rename your Virtual Environment](https://medium.com/@jisosceles/don-t-rename-your-virtualenv-projects-1049e47e1261)**. `activate` use your old name, if you change your virtual environment name, it cannot find the path unless you can change the info referred by `activate` command.

If you ==really really have to rename== your virtual Environment:

- activate your old environment and `pip freeze > requirement.txt` , then `deactivate` it.
- create a new environment then `activate` it.
- by command `pip install -r requirement.txt` to finish the rename operation.
- delete the old Virtual Environment.

# Conclusion

**Virtual Environment is developed based on projects**

- we have many python-based projects in our computer
    - these different python projects possess various **packages** and **python interpreters** or **python version**.
    - ==in order to seperate different projects, we introcude virtual environment to achieve isolate different projects==
- In order to manipute different project, we need first enter into projects and then manage them
    - enter virtual environment ——activate script
    - project package manager —– pip
    - python interpreter —— python softlink
- different packages need different way to use
    - directly download —– wheel file
    - download and build —– need c/c++ head file to compile these downloaded files
