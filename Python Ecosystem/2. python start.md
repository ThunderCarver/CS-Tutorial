When you’re first learning a new programming language, a lot of your time and effort go into understanding the **`syntax`**, **`code style`**, and **`built-in tool`**. This is just as true for Python as it is for any other language. Once you gain enough familiarity to be comfortable with the ins and outs of Python, you can start to invest time into building a Python environment that will foster your productivity.

Although no two developers have the same setup, there are a number of choices everyone faces when cultivating their Python environment. It’s important to understand each of these decisions and the options which are available to you!

**by the end of the article,you’ll be able to answer questions like:** - [x] What shell should I use? ——bash, zsh, fish, ksh, sh, tsch - [x] What version of Python can I use? —— as you want - [x] How do I manage dependencies for different projects? ——–virtual environment - [x] How can I make my tools do some of the work for me? ———Python Interpreters

## 1.Terminal 
运行所有指令的“载体”，并向用户反馈结果 *(text input/output environment)*

Terminal stands for **the environment that you input sth and get output**. Almost any terminal you encounter should support the same basic features:

- **Text colors** for syntax highlighting in your code or distinguishing meaningful text in command output.
- **Scrolling** for viewing an earlier command or its output
- **Copy/paste** for transferring text in or out of the shell from other programs
- **Tabs** for running multiple programs at once or separating your work into different sessions

Mac terminal supports all the usual functionality, and you can also customize the color scheme and a few hotkeys.

### iTerm2

I’ve been a long-time user of [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/). It takes the developer experience on Mac a step further, offering a much wider palette of customization and productivity options that enable you to:

- Integrate with the shell to jump quickly to previously entered commands
- Create custom search term highlighting in the output from commands
- Open URLs and files displayed in the terminal with Cmd+click

A Python API ships with the latest versions of iTerm2, so you can even improve your Python chops by developing more intricate customizations! iTerm2 is popular enough to enjoy first-class integration with several other tools, and has a healthy community building plugins and so on. It’s a good choice because of its more frequent release cycle compared to Terminal, which only updates as often as macOS does.

## 2.Shells

Shell stands for **the program that can understand your command**. When you use a command-line interface (CLI), you execute commands and see their output. A shell is a program that provides usually text-based interface to you. Shells often provide their own programming language that you can use to manipulate files, install software, and so on.

### Unix Shells

[Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) is a family of operating systems **first** developed in the early days of computing. Unix’s popularity has lasted through today, heavily inspiring Linux and macOS. The first shells were developed for use with Unix and Unix-like operating systems.

### Bourne Shell(sh)

The Bourne shell—developed by Stephen Bourne for Bell Labs in 1979—was one of the **first to incorporate the idea of environment variables, conditionals, and loops**. It has provided a strong basis for many other shells in use today and is still available on most systems at `/bin/sh`.

### Bourne-Again Shell (bash)

Built on the success of the original Bourne shell, bash introduced improved user-interaction features. With bash, you get `Tab` completion, history, and wildcard searching for commands and paths. The bash programming language provides more data types, like arrays. 

### Z Shell(zsh)

zsh combines many of the best features from other shells along with a few of its own tricks. zsh offers autocorrection of misspelled commands, shorthand for manipulating multiple files, and advanced options for customizing your command prompt. macOS will ship with zsh as its default shell starting with Catalina, speaking to the shell’s popularity. Consider acquainting yourself with zsh now so that you’ll be comfortable with it going forward.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

Microsoft has released a [Windows subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) (WSL) for running Linux directly on Windows. If you install WSL, then you can use zsh, bash, or any other Unix-like shell. If you want strong compatibility across your Windows and macOS or Linux environments, then be sure to give WSL a try. You may also consider dual-booting Linux and Windows](https://opensource.com/article/18/5/dual-boot-linux) as an alternative. 

## 3.Python Version Management

要使用的python版本

**With your choice of terminal and shell made, you can focus your attention on your Python environment specifically**. Something you’ll eventually run into is the need to run multiple versions of Python. Projects you use may only run on certain versions, or you may be interested in creating a project that supports multiple Python versions.
How do you navigate this? Tooling is here to help.

### conda

If you’re in the data science community, you might already be using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)). Anaconda is a sort of one-stop shop for data science software that supports more than just Python.**install specific python version**

`conda install python=3.7.5` **another way to install specific python version for specific project**:`conda create -n /my/virtual/environment/path/myenv python=needed version` The above command indicates that conda will install the specified version of Python if it isn’t already installed, so you don’t have to run `conda install  python=3.7.5` first. And you’ll see a verbose list of all the dependent software conda will install, and it will ask you to confirm.

If you don’t need the data science packages or all the things that come pre-packaged with Anaconda, pyenv might be a better lightweight solution for you. Managing Python versions is pretty similar in each, though. 

### pyenv

[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is a mature tool for installing and managing multiple Python versions on macOS. I recommend installing it with [Homebrew](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#homebrew-on-macos). If you’re using Windows, you can use [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#installation). After you’ve got pyenv installed, you can install multiple versions of Python into your Python environment with a few short commands:

```bash
$ pyenv versions * system 
$ python --version                 Python 2.7.10 
$ pyenv install 3.7.3    # This may take some time
$ pyenv versions * system   3.7.3
```

## 4.Virtual Environments Management

为你的内容创建一个python虚拟环境

### conda

conda create virtual environment

```
conda create -n path/myenv python=3.7.6
```

each `myenv` is an virtual environment in which the python version is specified by above command

### venv

venv ships with Python versions 3.3+. You can create virtual environments just by passing it a path at which to store the environment’s python, installed packages, and so on:

`python3.7.6 -m venv your/virtual/environment/path/myenv` venv is nice because it provides the utility of virtual environments without requiring you to install additional software. **the only limination is** You can probably get pretty far with it if you’re working mostly in a **single Python version** in your Python environment.**If you want to manipulate several python versions at same time**,you can consider **`conda`** as an option.The pyenv and conda ecosystems both provide ways to specify the Python version to use when you create new virtual environments. 

## 5.Python Interpreters

找一个python指令解释器

### normal python terminal

The Python interpreter provides a read-eval-print loop (REPL), which is what comes up when you type python with no arguments in your shell:

```
$ python
Python 3.7.3 (default, Jun 17 2020, 8:09:05)
[Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 2 + 2
4.
>>> exit()
```

The REPL reads what you type, evaluates it as Python code, and prints the result. Then it waits to do it all over again. This is about as much as the default Python REPL provides, which is sufficient for a good portion of typical work.

### IPython( the REPL used in Jupyter)

[IPython](https://ipython.org/) is a suite of tools supporting more than just Python, but one of its main features is an alternative Python REPL.IPython’s REPL numbers each command and explicitly labels each command’s input and output. After installing IPython (pip install ipython), you can run the ipython command in place of the python command to use the IPython REPL:

```
Python 3.7.3
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 6.0.0.dev -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

In [1]: 2 + 2
Out[1]: 4

In [2]: print("Hello!")
Out[2]: Hello!
```

IPython also supports `Tab` completion, more powerful help features, and strong integration with other tooling such as [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for graphing. IPython provided the foundation for [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), and both have been used extensively in the data science community because of their integration with other tools. 

### bpython

[bpython](https://bpython-interpreter.org/) is another alternative REPL that provides inline ***syntax highlighting***, ***tab completion*** , and even ***auto-suggestions*** as you type. It provides quite a few of the quick benefits of IPython without altering the interface much. Without the weight of the integrations and so on, bpython might be good to add to your repertoire for a while to see how it improves your use of the REPL.

## Some Tips and Tricks

Have you ever noticed **`*.pyc`** files all over your project directories? These files are pre-compiled Python bytecode—they help Python start your application faster. In production, these are a great idea because they’ll give you some performance gain. During local development, however, they’re rarely useful. Set **`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`** to disable this behavior. If you find use cases for them later, then you can easily remove this from your Python environment.

## Conclusion

- choose a terminal theme with the aesthetics and enhanced features you like
- Choose a shell with as many customization options as you need
- Manage multiple versions of Python on your system (conda or pyenv)
- Manage multiple projects that use a single version of Python, using virtual Python environments (venv)
- Install packages in your virtual environments (pip or conda)
- Choose a REPL that suits your interactive coding needs
